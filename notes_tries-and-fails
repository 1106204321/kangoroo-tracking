Selecting most significant key points:
- Picking the n key points with the highest contract did not work, as they only matched a very small area (jaw of a person).
- selecting randomly n key points.


Training SVM:
- Using 2 128-sift vectors results with 99 training examples results in an error rate of ~0.35.
- Using neighbourhood pixel values does not improve rate (~0.38)


Problems:
- bounding boxes gets smaller after every iteration. if it is slightly enlarged every time it loses ratio.


Matching key points:
- SVM: performs badly (theory: SVM not good enough)
- ubcmatch: 
- matching key point descriptors using minimun of euclidean distance: not working :(
